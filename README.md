# tennessee-state-education-data

### Description

This project contains code used to analyze Tennessee's public education files. The files were cleaned and combined to build longitudinal datasets to provide education leaders in Tennessee insight into school performance. Proprietary PowerPoint (not available here) was created with the narrative of the educational landscape pre- and post-COVID.
